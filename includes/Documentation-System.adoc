== Documentation System

This project uses an automated documentation system powered by GitHub Actions, AsciiDoctor, and PlantUML to maintain comprehensive technical documentation.

=== Architecture Overview

The documentation system automatically converts source files into multiple output formats whenever changes are detected:

=== Documentation Sources

**AsciiDoc Files** (`*.asciidoc`)::
- Main project documentation written in AsciiDoc markup language
- Supports advanced formatting, cross-references, and code highlighting
- Automatically converted to HTML and PDF formats
- Supports modular content through include directives

**PlantUML Diagrams** (`*.plantuml`)::
- Technical diagrams and flowcharts written in PlantUML text format
- Sequence diagrams for system interactions and workflows
- Architecture diagrams showing component relationships
- Automatically converted to PNG images for web display

**Include Files** (`includes/*.adoc`)::
- Modular content sections for reusability across documents
- Glossary definitions and appendices
- Shared content blocks to maintain consistency

=== Build Process

The GitHub Actions workflow (`build-docs.yml`) automatically:

. **Triggers** on changes to `.asciidoc` or `.plantuml` files
. **Installs Dependencies**:
  - Java 17 (Temurin distribution) for PlantUML execution
  - AsciiDoctor and AsciiDoctor-PDF gems for document processing
  - Graphviz for PlantUML diagram rendering
  - PlantUML JAR file for diagram generation
. **Processes Documents**:
  - Converts each `.asciidoc` file to HTML and PDF in `docs/` directory
  - Generates PNG images from `.plantuml` files in place
. **Commits Results**:
  - Automatically commits generated files with `[skip ci]` to prevent build loops
  - Updates repository with latest documentation builds

=== Generated Output

**HTML Documentation** (`docs/*.html`)::
- Web-ready documentation with embedded images and styling
- Cross-linked navigation and searchable content
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

**PDF Documentation** (`docs/*.pdf`)::
- Print-ready documents with professional formatting
- Suitable for offline reading and archival purposes
- Maintains consistent branding and layout

**PNG Diagrams** (`images/*.png`, `**/*.png`)::
- High-quality images generated from PlantUML source
- Embedded in HTML documentation and usable standalone
- Version-controlled alongside source diagrams

=== Content Guidelines

**AsciiDoc Best Practices**::
- Use semantic markup with proper heading hierarchy
- Include code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting: `[source,bash]`, `[source,json]`, etc.
- Reference diagrams using relative paths: `image::images/diagram.png[]`
- Use definition lists for structured information

**PlantUML Standards**::
- Include descriptive titles and footers in diagrams
- Use consistent styling with `skinparam` declarations
- Group related interactions with `group` and `box` elements
- Follow naming conventions for participants and components

**File Organization**::
- Main documentation in root `.asciidoc` files
- Diagrams organized in `images/` directory
- Shared content in `includes/` directory
- Generated output in `docs/` directory (Git-tracked)

=== Maintenance and Updates

**Automatic Builds**::
- No manual intervention required for documentation updates
- Changes to source files trigger automatic regeneration
- Generated files are committed back to repository automatically

**Local Development**::
- Install AsciiDoctor locally for preview during development
- Use PlantUML plugins in editors for diagram preview
- Test builds locally before pushing to repository

**Version Control**::
- Source files (`.asciidoc`, `.plantuml`) are primary artifacts
- Generated files are tracked for easy deployment and viewing
- Build logs available in GitHub Actions for troubleshooting

This automated system ensures documentation stays current with code changes and provides multiple formats for different use cases, from web browsing to professional PDF reports.

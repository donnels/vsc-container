AsciiDoctor:: A fast text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to HTML5, DocBook, PDF, and other formats. Used in this project for documentation generation and technical writing with live preview capabilities.
Cloudflare:: A content delivery network and DNS service provider that offers domain management, security, and performance services. Used in this project for DNS management and API-based DNS-01 challenge validation for Let's Encrypt certificates.
CoreDNS:: A DNS server written in Go that chains plugins to provide flexible DNS services. Used in this project for internal service discovery within the vsagcrd.org domain, providing hostname resolution for container-to-container communication.
DNS-01 Challenge:: A Let's Encrypt ACME challenge method that validates domain ownership by requiring the client to create a specific DNS TXT record. Used with Cloudflare API for automated certificate generation without requiring the server to be publicly accessible.
Let's Encrypt:: A free, automated certificate authority that provides SSL/TLS certificates through the ACME protocol. Used in this project to generate production-grade SSL certificates for secure HTTPS communication.
PlantUML:: A tool for creating UML diagrams from plain text descriptions. Used in this project for generating technical architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, and system documentation with Java runtime and Graphviz support.
Reverse Proxy:: A server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to backend servers and returning responses back to clients. In this project, Nginx serves as a reverse proxy providing SSL termination, security headers, and routing to the VS Code service.
SSL Termination:: The process of decrypting SSL/TLS traffic at a proxy server before forwarding unencrypted traffic to backend services. Implemented in this project at the Nginx proxy layer for centralized certificate management and security.
Vsagcrd:: Virtual Space and Global Communications Research Department - Place holder company created By Sean Donnelan as a hanger for projects like this one.
code-server:: An open-source implementation of Visual Studio Code that runs on a remote server and is accessible through a web browser. Provides the full VS Code experience including extensions, integrated terminal, and debugging capabilities.
mkcert:: A simple tool for making locally trusted development certificates. Previously used in this project but has been replaced by Let's Encrypt certificates for both development and production environments to ensure consistent SSL behavior.

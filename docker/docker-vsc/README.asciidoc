= Docker Directory

This directory contains everything needed to build and run the containerized VS Code server environment for remote development.

== Contents

- `Dockerfile`: Builds the code-server image with Nginx and SSL support.
- `nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration for SSL termination and reverse proxy to code-server.
- `generate_certs.sh`: Script to generate self-signed SSL certificates.
- `.env.template`: Example environment file for configuration variables.
- `code-server.yaml`: Docker Compose file to orchestrate the code-server and Nginx services.

== How it Works

. Build the image and start the services with Docker Compose:
+
----
docker-compose -f code-server.yaml up
----
. The `generate_certs.sh` script runs to create SSL certificates for Nginx.
. Nginx terminates SSL and proxies requests to the code-server running on port 8080.
. The code-server UI is protected by a login prompt ("Virtual Sace Research") and uses a secure password hash for authentication.
. Access your remote VS Code environment at `https://<your-virtual-host>:443`.

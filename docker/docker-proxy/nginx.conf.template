# This file is deprecated - HAProxy configuration moved to haproxy.cfg.template
# This file is kept for reference only and should be removed in future cleanup
# 
# Current architecture uses:
# - haproxy.cfg.template: Forward proxy with HTTPS tunneling
# - nginx-temp.conf: LCARS interface (static files served by nginx)
#
# The forward proxy architecture eliminates the need for nginx SSL configuration
# as HAProxy handles HTTPS tunneling transparently without SSL termination.

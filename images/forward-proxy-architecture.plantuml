note over proxy
**HAProxy Forward Proxy**
- Port 8443: HTTPS forward proxy (self-signed cert)
- Port 8080: LCARS status interface (HTTP)
- IP: 172.20.0.11
- Hostname: forward-proxy.vsagcrd.org
end note

note over vscode
**VS Code Server**
- Port 8443: HTTPS (Let's Encrypt cert)
- IP: 172.20.0.12
- Hostname: code-dev.vsagcrd.org
- Certificate: Real Let's Encrypt
end note

note over dns
**CoreDNS**
- Port 53: DNS resolution
- IP: 172.20.0.10
- Resolves *.vsagcrd.org domains
end note

note over certbot
**Certbot (Tools Profile)**
- IP: 172.20.0.13
- Generates Let's Encrypt certificates
- DNS-01 challenge via Cloudflare
end note

== Certificate Generation (One-time Setup) ==
certbot -> certbot: Generate Let's Encrypt certificate
note right: For code-dev.vsagcrd.org
certbot -> dns: Verify internal DNS resolution
certbot -> vscode: Deliver certificate files

== Forward Proxy Configuration ==
user -> headset: Configure proxy settings
note right
HTTP Proxy: steamdeck.fritz.box:8443
HTTPS Proxy: steamdeck.fritz.box:8443
SSL: Accept self-signed certificate
end note

== LCARS Interface Access ==
headset -> router: HTTP request
router -> proxy: Forward to port 8080
proxy -> nginx: Serve LCARS interface
nginx -> headset: Status page and configuration

== HTTPS Tunneling Flow ==
headset -> router: CONNECT code-dev.vsagcrd.org:8443
router -> proxy: Forward CONNECT request (port 8443)
proxy -> dns: Resolve code-dev.vsagcrd.org
dns -> proxy: Return 172.20.0.12
proxy -> vscode: Establish tunnel connection
vscode -> proxy: SSL handshake (Let's Encrypt cert)
proxy -> headset: Tunnel established

group Transparent HTTPS Tunnel
    headset -> proxy: Encrypted VSCode traffic
    note right: End-to-end encryption preserved
    proxy -> vscode: Forwarded without decryption
    vscode -> proxy: VSCode responses
    proxy -> headset: Forwarded responses
    note right: WebSocket connections work transparently

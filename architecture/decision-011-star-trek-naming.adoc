:ARC-TITLE: Star Trek Themed Service Naming Convention
:ARC-TOPIC: naming
:ARC-STATUS: accepted

[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

Warp bubble requires consistent naming convention for services, containers, network components. Technical naming alone lacks memorable character and thematic cohesion.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Generic technical names like "container-1", "web-server", "proxy-service" are forgettable and provide no context about system purpose or relationships. Need memorable, consistent naming that enhances understanding and creates cohesive development experience.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Generic Technical Names

.Pro
* Industry standard approach
* Immediately obvious functionality
* No cultural context required

.Con
* Boring and forgettable
* No personality or character
* Difficult to remember in complex systems

=== Random Creative Names

.Pro
* Memorable and unique
* Creative expression
* Easy to remember

.Con
* No systematic organization
* Arbitrary relationships
* Difficult to scale consistently

=== Star Trek Themed Names

.Pro
* Systematic naval/military organization
* Rich source material for consistent naming
* Memorable and engaging
* Technical metaphors align with functionality
* Scalable naming hierarchy

.Con
* Cultural context required
* May seem unprofessional
* Limited to specific domain knowledge

== Decision Outcome

Adopt Star Trek themed naming convention for all warp bubble services and components, using naval hierarchy and technical systems as naming foundation.

=== Justification

Star Trek provides rich, systematic naming conventions that map well to technical infrastructure. Naval hierarchy provides clear organizational structure while technical systems offer functional metaphors that enhance understanding.

=== Consequences

* Consistent thematic naming across all services
* Enhanced memorability and engagement
* Clear hierarchical organization
* Technical metaphors support understanding
* Distinctive project identity

=== Naming Conventions

* **ENTERPRISE**: Main development environment (steam deck)
* **SHUTTLE**: VR headset
* **SHUTTLEBAY**: Landing zone and service discovery
* **TRANSPORTER**: Forward proxy for external access
* **DEFLECTOR**: Certificate management and HTTPS termination
* **OPTICAL-DATA-NETWORK**: MQTT message bus
* **LOCATOR-MATRIX**: DNS resolution services
* **VALIDATRIX**: Test container for device compatibility
* **ENGINEERING-CONSOLE**: LCARS monitoring interface

=== Naming Principles

* Ship systems for infrastructure services
* Location names for user-facing services
* Technical systems for specialized functions
* Rank structure for hierarchical components
* Consistent Star Trek universe terminology

=== Derived / Related Decisions

* LCARS interface design supports naming theme (<<ARCID-007>>)
* DNS infrastructure uses themed hostnames (<<ARCID-003>>)
* MQTT topics incorporate themed service names (<<ARCID-010>>)

= ARCID-011: Star Trek Themed Service Naming Convention
:toc: right

== Status
Accepted

== Context
The warp bubble development environment initially used generic technical names for services (coredns, squid, code-server, certbot, etc.). While functionally descriptive, these names lack personality and can be difficult to remember, especially when managing multiple interconnected services. In the context of the LCARS interface design (<<ARCID-007>>) and the Star Trek themed aesthetic, there's an opportunity to create a more cohesive and memorable naming system.

Technical service names often become abstract identifiers that don't convey the actual role or relationship of components within the system. This can lead to:

* Cognitive overhead when managing services
* Difficulty onboarding new team members
* Lack of intuitive understanding of service relationships
* Missed opportunities for creating a more engaging development experience

The Star Trek universe provides a rich vocabulary for describing ship systems and operations that maps well to development infrastructure concepts.

== Decision
We will adopt a comprehensive Star Trek themed naming convention for all services, directories, and DNS names within the warp bubble environment:

=== Service Mapping
* **locator-matrix** (CoreDNS): The ship's navigation and positioning system, responsible for locating and directing traffic to other services
* **transporter** (Squid Proxy): Safely beams requests through hostile network territory to their destinations
* **engineering-console** (VS Code Server): The primary development workstation where engineering work is performed
* **deflector** (Certbot): Deflector array generates protective shields (certificates) against security threats
* **shuttlebay** (Landing Page): The docking bay where visitors first arrive and receive directions
* **console** (LCARS Interface): The main bridge interface for system control and monitoring
* **optical-data-network** (MQTT): The ship's high-speed communication network for inter-system messaging
* **warpbubble** (Docker Network): The protective field that contains and isolates all ship systems

=== Benefits
* **Memorability**: Star Trek names are more distinctive and easier to remember than generic technical terms
* **Intuitive Relationships**: The metaphors help understand service interactions (transporter moves things, deflector protects, etc.)
* **Consistent Theme**: Aligns with LCARS interface design for a cohesive user experience
* **Playful Engagement**: Makes development work more enjoyable and engaging
* **Functional Description**: Each name actually describes the service's role in an accessible way
* **Team Building**: Shared cultural reference creates common vocabulary and team identity

=== Implementation
* All container names in docker-compose.yaml updated to Star Trek themed names
* Directory structure renamed to match container names
* Environment variables follow WARPBUBBLE_* pattern
* DNS aliases include both functional and themed names for compatibility
* Documentation updated to reflect new naming convention

== Consequences

=== Positive
* Increased developer engagement and enjoyment
* More intuitive service identification and relationships
* Consistent thematic experience across all interfaces
* Easier onboarding for team members familiar with Star Trek
* Natural conversation vocabulary for discussing system components
* Better alignment with LCARS interface design philosophy

=== Negative
* May confuse developers unfamiliar with Star Trek references
* Requires documentation to map themed names to underlying technologies
* Some resistance to change from traditional naming conventions
* Need to maintain both themed and technical understanding

=== Neutral
* No impact on service functionality or performance
* Gradual adoption possible through DNS aliases
* Can coexist with technical documentation

== Compliance
This decision enhances:
* <<ARCID-007>>: LCARS Interface Design - creates consistent thematic experience
* <<ARCID-005>>: Centralized Configuration - environment variables follow unified WARPBUBBLE_ pattern
* <<ARCID-003>>: DNS Infrastructure - themed aliases improve service discovery

== Notes
The naming convention maintains technical accuracy while adding personality. Each name was chosen to reflect the actual function of the service in a way that's both memorable and descriptive. The Star Trek metaphor is internally consistent and helps developers think about the system as an integrated whole rather than a collection of disparate components.

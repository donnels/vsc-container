:arc-title: Data Sources for Development and Analysis

= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}

== Context

During development, only open source data and operational data from the environment are used. No proprietary data is ingested.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Neo4j and other analysis tools require data sources for graph construction and experimentation. Data must be freely available or generated by the system.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Open Source Data Sets
Publicly available network, system, and infrastructure data sets. Easy to obtain, no licensing issues.

=== Operational Data from Environment
Data generated by the running containers and services. Includes logs, metrics, and configuration.

=== SNMP Recordings (LibreNMS)
SNMP data collected by LibreNMS from devices. Good starting point for Neo4j graph construction. Provides device, interface, and topology information.

=== IP Flow-Based Data
NetFlow, sFlow, or similar flow records. Harder to obtain, may require custom collection or simulation. Useful for traffic analysis and advanced graph modeling.

== Decision Outcome

Use open source and operational data only during development. SNMP recordings from LibreNMS prioritized for initial Neo4j graph population. IP flow data considered for future phases if collection becomes feasible.

== Justification

* Avoids licensing and privacy issues
* Enables reproducible experiments
* SNMP data provides rich network topology for graph analysis
* Flow data adds value but is not required for initial development

== Consequences

* No sensitive or proprietary data risk during development
* Data sources may be limited in scope and realism
* Future production may require new data ingestion and compliance review

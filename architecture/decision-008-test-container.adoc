:ARC-STATUS: accepted

[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

Warp bubble supports multiple device types: VR headsets, Apple devices, Linux systems, Android tablets, phones. Each has different HTTPS support, network configuration, browser features, proxy compatibility.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Devices vary in:
- HTTPS certificate handling and trust chains
- Proxy configuration methods (PAC files, manual settings)
- Network discovery and connectivity features
- Browser capabilities and security restrictions
- VR-specific interface rendering

Without systematic testing, users encounter compatibility issues and poor UX.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Manual Testing on Each Device

.Pro
* Real-world testing conditions
* Authentic user experience validation
* No additional infrastructure

.Con
* Time-consuming and repetitive
* Inconsistent test environments
* Difficult to reproduce issues
* No automated regression testing
* Limited scalability

=== Dedicated Test Container Environment

.Pro
* Isolated testing environment
* Consistent test conditions
* Automated capability detection via web interface
* Easy to reproduce and debug issues
* HTTP and HTTPS test endpoints
* Real-time device capability reporting
* Accessible from inside and outside warp bubble

.Con
* Additional container infrastructure required
* May not perfectly replicate device-specific behaviors
* Requires test script development

== Decision Outcome

Implement dedicated test container within warp bubble providing web-based capability detection pages accessible via HTTP and HTTPS from inside and outside warp bubble network.

=== Justification

Test container with web-based capability detection provides automated device analysis without manual testing procedures. HTTP and HTTPS test endpoints accessible from inside and outside warp bubble enable devices to automatically report capabilities, limitations, and compatibility status.

=== Consequences

* Test container serving web-based capability detection pages (Named VALIDATRIX)
* HTTP and HTTPS endpoints for comprehensive protocol testing
* Automated device capability reporting and analysis
* Real-time browser feature detection (WebSocket, service workers, etc.)
* Certificate trust chain validation testing
* Proxy configuration compatibility assessment
* Network connectivity testing from multiple access points
* Device-specific limitation documentation
* Capability matrix generation for supported devices

=== Test Coverage Areas

* **Apple Devices**: Safari certificate handling, iOS proxy settings, macOS network configuration
* **Linux Systems**: Firefox/Chrome certificate stores, network manager proxy integration
* **Android Tablets**: Chrome mobile proxy support, certificate installation procedures
* **VR Headsets**: WebXR browser capabilities, LCARS interface rendering
* **Mobile Phones**: Limited support validation, fallback interface testing

=== Testing Scenarios

* HTTPS certificate validation and trust chain verification
* Proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file functionality
* Manual proxy configuration procedures
* Network discovery and connectivity testing
* LCARS interface rendering across screen sizes
* Browser security feature compatibility
* WebSocket and service worker functionality

=== Implementation Requirements

* Web server providing capability detection on HTTP and HTTPS
* JavaScript-based browser feature detection and reporting
* Device capability analysis and results display interface
* Certificate validation testing via HTTPS endpoints
* Proxy connectivity testing from multiple network positions
* User-agent and device characteristic detection
* Real-time capability reporting and logging
* Results export and documentation generation
* Integration with existing warp bubble network infrastructure
* External access points for testing outside warp bubble connectivity

=== Derived / Related Decisions

* HTTPS certificates required (<<ARCID-001>>)
* Forward tunneling proxy implementation (<<ARCID-002>>)
* Landing zone server for proxy configuration (<<ARCID-004>>)
* LCARS interface design for VR environment (<<ARCID-007>>)

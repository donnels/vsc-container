[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

Warp bubble requires centralized configuration management for DNS resolution, certificates, and service discovery. Services need consistent access to environment variables and configuration data.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Environment variables scattered across multiple Docker Compose files create inconsistency. Configuration changes require modifications in multiple locations. Service discovery needs central configuration source.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Distributed Configuration Files

.Pro
* Simple per-service configuration
* No external dependencies
* Service isolation

.Con
* Configuration drift
* Inconsistent variable naming
* Difficult centralized updates

=== External Configuration Server

.Pro
* Professional configuration management
* Versioning capabilities
* Remote management

.Con
* Additional infrastructure complexity
* External dependencies
* Overkill for development environment

=== Centralized Environment File

.Pro
* Single source of truth
* Consistent variable naming
* Easy updates
* Version control integration

.Con
* Single point of failure
* All services share configuration visibility

== Decision Outcome

Use centralized `.env` file with consistent variable naming for all warp bubble services.

=== Justification

Simplest approach for development environment. Provides configuration consistency without external dependencies. Enables easy updates and version control.

=== Consequences

* Single `.env` file for all services
* Consistent variable naming convention
* Docker Compose env_file integration
* Configuration version control
* Simplified deployment

=== Derived / Related Decisions

* DNS infrastructure uses central configuration (<<ARCID-003>>)
* HTTPS certificates reference shared variables (<<ARCID-001>>)
* Service discovery relies on central naming (all services)

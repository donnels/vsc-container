:ARC-TOPIC: platform
:ARC-STATUS: accepted

[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

Mobile development platform needed. Must support untethered development, desktop docking, container workloads, AI inference, and VR development.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Traditional setups fail:
- Desktops: Powerful, not portable
- Laptops: Limited battery, processing power  
- Cloud: Requires internet
- Mobile: Insufficient power
- SBC: Weak + airport security issues

Need mobile platform with portability, power, battery life, containers, VR support.

== Alternatives Considered

=== High-End Gaming Laptop

.Pro
* Maximum computing power
* Large screen and full keyboard
* Extensive port selection
* Traditional development environment

.Con
* Heavy and bulky for mobile use
* Poor battery life under load
* High cost ($2000-4000+)
* No native gaming handheld ergonomics
* Limited VR portability

=== MacBook Pro/Air

.Pro
* Excellent build quality and battery life
* Good performance for development
* Unix-based development environment
* Lightweight and portable

.Con
* Very high cost ($1500-3000+)
* Limited container/VM performance on ARM
* No native gaming capabilities
* Poor VR development support
* Closed ecosystem limitations

=== Steam Deck with Podman

.Pro
* Excellent price-to-performance ratio ($400-650)
* True handheld portability with great ergonomics
* Desktop Linux with full container support
* Strong battery life for mobile development
* Native gaming capabilities for testing
* VR headset compatibility (Quest 3)
* Docking station converts to desktop workstation
* Sufficient power for small AI models (LLaMA)
* Bluetooth keyboard support for serious development

.Con
* Smaller screen requires external display for extended work
* Limited built-in storage (expandable via SD)
* Gaming-focused design may seem unprofessional
* Learning curve for SteamOS/desktop mode

== Decision Outcome

Steam Deck primary mobile platform. Podman orchestration. Bluetooth keyboard + Quest 3 VR for untethered development.

=== Justification

Optimal balance: cost, performance, portability, capability. Handheld + desktop docking + battery life + Linux containers. Gaming heritage ensures VR compatibility. Accessible price.

=== Consequences

* Steam Deck with SteamOS/Desktop Linux
* Podman instead of Docker
* Bluetooth keyboard integration
* Quest 3 VR compatibility
* Phone hotspot connectivity
* Docking station for desktop mode
* SD card storage expansion
* Power optimization for mobile sessions

=== Mobile Development Setup

* **Untethered**: Steam Deck + Bluetooth keyboard + Quest 3 + phone hotspot
* **Tethered**: Steam Deck + docking station + external monitor + desktop setup
* **Power**: Optimized container limits for battery efficiency
* **Storage**: SD card expansion for projects and images
* **Network**: Phone hotspot primary, WiFi secondary, ethernet when docked

=== Technical Capabilities

* **Containers**: Full Podman/Docker compatibility
* **AI**: Sufficient CPU/GPU for small LLaMA inference
* **VR**: Native Quest 3 compatibility
* **Battery**: 4-8 hours depending on workload
* **Performance**: Adequate for VS Code, web development, containers
* **Expandability**: USB-C docking for desktop capabilities

=== Cost Analysis

* Steam Deck: $400-650
* Bluetooth Keyboard: $50-150
* Quest 3 VR: $500-650
* Total: $950-1450 (vs $2000-4000 laptop + VR)
* Exceptional value: Desktop + mobile + gaming + VR in one package

=== Derived / Related Decisions

* DNS infrastructure within warp bubble (<<ARCID-003>>)
* Centralized environment configuration (<<ARCID-005>>)
* LCARS interface design for VR environment (<<ARCID-007>>)
* Test container for multi-device compatibility (<<ARCID-008>>)

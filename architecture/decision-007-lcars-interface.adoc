[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

Warp bubble development environment needs system status monitoring and control interface. Star Trek LCARS design provides thematic consistency with naming convention.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Development environment requires operational status visibility. System monitoring needs intuitive interface for service health, network status, and basic controls.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Traditional Admin Dashboard

.Pro
* Familiar interface patterns
* Comprehensive feature sets
* Industry standard

.Con
* Generic appearance
* Complex implementation
* Overkill for development use

=== Command Line Only

.Pro
* Minimal resource usage
* Direct system access
* Fast operation

.Con
* Poor user experience
* No visual status indicators
* Mobile device unfriendly

=== LCARS-Themed Interface

.Pro
* Thematic consistency
* Unique visual design
* CSS-only implementation possible
* Mobile-friendly design

.Con
* Non-standard interface patterns
* Limited UI component libraries

== Decision Outcome

Implement LCARS-themed monitoring interface for system status and basic controls.

=== Justification

LCARS design provides thematic consistency with Star Trek naming convention while offering unique visual appeal. CSS-only implementation keeps complexity minimal.

=== Consequences

* Custom CSS for LCARS styling
* Simple HTML interface sufficient
* Thematic consistency with naming
* Distinctive visual identity
* Mobile-responsive design needed

=== Derived / Related Decisions

* Star Trek naming convention (<<ARCID-011>>)
* Landing zone provides service access (<<ARCID-004>>)
* Test container for interface validation (<<ARCID-008>>)

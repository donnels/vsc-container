[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

The warp bubble development environment is designed to be used with VR headsets in immersive environments. Traditional web interfaces with small buttons, complex layouts, and detailed text are difficult to use in VR due to resolution limitations and interaction challenges. The space station/sci-fi theme enhances immersion when working in virtual environments.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Standard web interfaces are not optimized for VR interaction. Small UI elements, complex navigation, and traditional design patterns create usability issues in VR headsets. Users need large, easily clickable interface elements with clear visual hierarchy. The interface should complement the immersive space-themed VR environment rather than break immersion with generic web design.

== Alternatives Considered

=== Traditional Bootstrap/Material Design

.Pro
* Familiar design patterns
* Extensive component libraries
* Responsive design built-in
* Wide browser compatibility

.Con
* Small interface elements difficult in VR
* Complex layouts hard to navigate with VR controllers
* Generic appearance breaks sci-fi immersion
* Not optimized for spatial interaction

=== LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System)

.Pro
* Large, easily clickable button elements
* High contrast design optimized for displays
* Simple, clear design language
* Fits perfectly with space station VR theme
* Iconic sci-fi aesthetic enhances immersion
* Designed for quick access and navigation

.Con
* Custom CSS development required
* Limited existing component libraries
* May appear dated to some users
* Requires custom design work

=== Custom VR-Optimized Interface

.Pro
* Specifically designed for VR interaction
* Could integrate 3D elements
* Optimized for spatial computing

.Con
* Significant development effort required
* No existing design system to leverage
* Complex maintenance overhead
* Browser compatibility challenges

== Decision Outcome

We will implement LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) interface design for all warp bubble web interfaces, particularly the console dashboard and landing pages.

=== Justification

LCARS provides the optimal balance of VR usability and thematic consistency. The large button elements and high contrast design make it ideal for VR headset interaction, while the Star Trek aesthetic perfectly complements the space station environment. The simple design language reduces cognitive load when navigating in VR.

=== Consequences

* Custom LCARS CSS framework development required
* Large, easily clickable interface elements throughout
* High contrast color scheme for VR visibility
* Simplified navigation patterns optimized for spatial interaction
* Enhanced immersion in space-themed VR environments
* Consistent sci-fi aesthetic across all interfaces
* Reduced eye strain in VR headsets

=== Design Principles

* **Large Touch Targets**: Buttons and interactive elements sized for VR controller precision
* **High Contrast**: Colors optimized for VR display visibility
* **Simple Navigation**: Clear hierarchical structure with minimal nesting
* **Spatial Awareness**: Interface elements positioned for comfortable VR viewing
* **Thematic Consistency**: Star Trek LCARS aesthetic throughout

=== Implementation Requirements

* LCARS CSS framework with VR-optimized dimensions
* Color palette designed for VR headset displays
* Large typography for VR readability
* Simple grid layouts avoiding complex responsive breakpoints
* Console interface with LCARS styling
* Landing page with space station theme integration

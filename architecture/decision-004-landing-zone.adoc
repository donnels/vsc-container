[#ARCID-{arc-id}]
= {arc-id} - {arc-topic} - {arc-title}
This decision is part of the {arc-topic} architecture.

== Context

Warp bubble services need proxy auto-configuration for external access. External clients require discovery endpoint for PAC files and service menu without prior network knowledge.

== Problem Statement / Motivation

Mobile clients need PAC file access to configure forward proxy for warp bubble services. External users need landing zone to discover available services without complex configuration.

== Alternatives Considered

=== PAC File Hosting Only

.Pro
* Minimal resource usage
* Simple implementation
* Direct service integration

.Con
* Poor user experience
* No service discovery
* Manual URL entry required

=== Full Dashboard Server

.Pro
* Rich user interface
* Service management capabilities
* Professional appearance

.Con
* Resource overhead for simple use case
* Complex implementation
* Authentication complexity

=== Landing Zone with Service Menu

.Pro
* Simple user interface
* PAC file hosting
* Service discovery
* Minimal resource overhead

.Con
* Basic functionality only
* Limited management capabilities

== Decision Outcome

Implement landing zone server that hosts PAC files and provides service menu for external clients.

=== Justification

Provides necessary PAC file hosting with minimal overhead. Service menu improves user experience by providing service discovery without complex configuration.

=== Consequences

* Nginx-based static file server
* PAC file served via HTTP/HTTPS
* Service menu provides discovery
* Simple HTML interface sufficient
* Minimal maintenance required

=== Derived / Related Decisions

* Forward proxy implementation required (<<ARCID-002>>)
* HTTPS certificates for security (<<ARCID-001>>)
* DNS for service resolution (<<ARCID-003>>)

== Executive Summary

Architecture decision process for warp bubble project using TOGAF's iterative ADM with experiment-driven validation. Prioritizes evidence over assumptions while maintaining TOGAF compliance.

== Architecture Development Philosophy

=== TOGAF-Compliant Iterative Process

**TOGAF ADM Principle**: Iterative cycles with stakeholder validation
**Our Implementation**: Rapid experimentation cycles with technical validation

=== Process Steps

. **Problem Identification** (TOGAF Phase A - Vision)
. **Rapid Prototyping** (TOGAF Phase B-D - Architecture Development)
. **Alternative Analysis** (TOGAF Phase E - Opportunities & Solutions)
. **Decision Documentation** (TOGAF Phase F - Migration Planning)
. **Implementation** (TOGAF Phase G - Implementation Governance)
. **Operational Learning** (TOGAF Phase H - Architecture Change Management)

== TOGAF ADM Implementation

=== One-Month Project Cycle Mapping

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| TOGAF Phase | Process Activity | Time Allocation

| Phase A - Vision
| Problem definition and success criteria
| 2 days (Week 1)

| Phase B-D - Architecture
| Prototype and constraint discovery
| 2-4 hours per issue

| Phase E - Solutions
| Alternative comparison with evidence
| 1-2 hours per decision

| Phase F - Migration
| ADR documentation
| 30 minutes per decision

| Phase G - Governance
| Implementation and monitoring
| Continuous

| Phase H - Change
| Feedback integration
| Weekly retrospective

=== Documentation Strategy

**Single Document per Major Decision**: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
**Trigger**: Cross-service impact OR reusable pattern OR blocking constraint
**Content**: Problem, tested alternatives, evidence, decision
**Skip**: Implementation-only decisions, obvious technical choices

**Terseness Rule**: Write like Hemingway, not Dickens. Remove superfluous words, redundant phrases, bureaucratic language. Humans and LLMs forget page one by page ten.

== Process Controls

=== Experiment Boundaries

**Time Limits**: 2-4 hours per prototype (not days)
**Resource Limits**: Single developer, existing tools
**Scope Limits**: Single blocking constraint per experiment
**Kill Criteria**: No progress after 2 hours OR simpler alternative exists

=== Decision Triggers

Document only when:
- Affects multiple services (cross-cutting concern)
- Creates reusable pattern for future use
- Blocks implementation progress
- Has security or compliance implications

Skip documentation for:
- Single-service implementation details
- Standard technology usage
- Obvious constraint workarounds

=== Conflict Resolution

**Technical disagreement**: 1-hour spike comparison, pick and move on
**Scope creep**: Defer to post-delivery iteration
**Unknown constraints**: Assume simplest case, validate later

=== Learning Integration

**Document pattern**: If solution applies to >1 service
**Document constraint**: If blocks future work
**Skip documentation**: Implementation-specific details

== TOGAF Compliance

=== Architecture Repository
- ADRs stored in version control with code
- Cross-references maintained automatically
- Decision history preserved with implementation

=== Stakeholder Management
* Individual developer: Implementation choices <2 hours
** Grab a coffee
* Project owner: Component decisions <4 hours
** Come back after lunch
* Business owner: Scope/feature decisions <24 hours
** Sleep over it

=== Architecture Governance
- **Standards Compliance**: Automated where possible, manual review for exceptions
- **Decision Review**: Real-time peer review preferred over formal process
- **Change Management**: Weekly architecture retrospective
- **Risk Management**: Time-boxed prototypes reduce implementation risk

=== One-Month Timeline Alignment
- **Week 1**: Vision phase, core infrastructure decisions
- **Week 2-3**: Architecture development with rapid prototyping
- **Week 4**: Implementation governance and documentation cleanup

== Success Metrics

=== Quantifiable Measures (One-Month Project)
- **Decision Speed**: Problem to solution in <4 hours
- **Documentation Overhead**: <5% of development time
- **Blocking Issues**: <2 per week requiring architecture intervention
- **Delivery Risk**: Project completes within 4 weeks

=== When This Approach Fails

**Use Traditional Upfront Architecture When:**
- Project timeline >3 months (more planning justified)
- Team >3 developers (coordination overhead increases)
- Integration requirements unknown (discovery phase needed)
- Client requires architecture approval before development

== Conclusion

This process adapts TOGAF's iterative ADM for rapid delivery timelines. Time-boxed experiments and selective documentation enable architecture decisions without slowing development velocity.

Success depends on aggressive scope management and deferring non-blocking decisions to post-delivery iterations.
